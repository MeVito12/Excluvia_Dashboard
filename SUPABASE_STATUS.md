# Supabase Integration Status

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### Database Schema
- 13 complete PostgreSQL tables defined with Drizzle ORM
- Type-safe schema with TypeScript interfaces
- Business category filtering across all tables
- User-based data isolation

### Storage System
- Database storage interface with full CRUD operations
- Mock storage implementation for development/demo
- Hybrid system with automatic fallback
- Transparent API layer

### Database Tables
1. **users** - User authentication and business categories
2. **products** - Inventory management with expiry tracking
3. **sales** - Sales transactions and payment tracking
4. **clients** - Customer relationship management
5. **appointments** - Scheduling and calendar management
6. **campaigns** - Loyalty campaigns and promotions
7. **whatsapp_chats** - Customer service conversations
8. **stock_movements** - Inventory movement tracking
9. **bot_configs** - AI assistant configurations
10. **support_agents** - Human support agent management
11. **integration_settings** - Third-party platform integrations
12. **notification_settings** - Communication preferences
13. **reminders** - Appointment reminder system

### API Integration
- All routes updated to use storage interface
- Database manager for connection handling
- Health check with database status
- Error handling with graceful fallback

## üîÑ Current Status

### Connection Status
- Supabase API: ‚úÖ Accessible and responding
- Service Key: ‚úÖ Configured and working
- Database schema: ‚è≥ Awaiting manual setup
- Connection pooling: ‚úÖ Configured
- SSL configuration: ‚úÖ Set up
- Migrations: ‚úÖ Generated and ready
- Environment: ‚ö†Ô∏è DNS limitations for direct connection

### Setup Required
üéØ **Next Step**: Execute SQL schema in Supabase Dashboard

The Supabase API is fully accessible and responding correctly. The database tables need to be created manually in the Supabase SQL Editor due to DNS limitations in the Replit environment.

**Instructions**: See `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide.

### Fallback System
The system currently uses comprehensive mock data while the database setup is completed. Once tables are created in Supabase, the system will automatically switch to using live database data.

## üöÄ Production Deployment

When deploying to production (outside Replit):
1. Database will automatically connect to Supabase
2. All CRUD operations will use PostgreSQL
3. Mock data system will be bypassed
4. Full performance with connection pooling

## üìä Mock Data Coverage

The fallback mock system includes realistic data for all 7 business categories:
- **farmacia** - Pharmaceutical products and sales
- **pet** - Veterinary services and products  
- **medico** - Medical consultations and treatments
- **alimenticio** - Restaurant orders and menu items
- **vendas** - Commercial sales and inventory
- **design** - Creative projects and portfolio
- **sites** - Web development projects

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Configuration
```typescript
- Driver: node-postgres with connection pooling
- SSL: Configured for Supabase
- Schema: Drizzle ORM with type safety
- Migrations: Auto-generated and ready for deployment
```

### Storage Interface
```typescript
- getUserByUsername()
- getProducts(), createProduct(), updateProduct(), deleteProduct()
- getSales(), createSale()
- getClients(), createClient(), updateClient(), deleteClient()
- getAppointments(), createAppointment(), updateAppointment(), deleteAppointment()
- getCampaigns(), createCampaign()
- getWhatsAppChats()
- getStockMovements(), createStockMovement()
```

The system is fully prepared for Supabase and will work seamlessly once DNS connectivity is established.
